do# Project Overview
This pipeline aims at processing user-supplied images. The user supplies the photograph of an object as input and the algorithm returns the top 3 most likely classes for the image and their probabilities.  

This project relies on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images. We use the pre-trained ResNet50 model to do so. This model is trained on a subset of the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) database, which is used in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC).
